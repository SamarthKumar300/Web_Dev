List of the tags

<strong> --> It is used to bring the importance to the element.By default , it makes the selected part bold.

<em> --> It is used for styling a particular section of the code which we can alter later into the CSS.


NOTE ---> 1. We can use wrap abbreviation through which we can wrap an abbreviation instead of manually warping a text
          2. In order to use the < and > sign in the HTML as a alphabet instead of the tag we have to use ENTITIES.
                Link to the ENTITIES list : https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_entities.asp
          3. To stick two words together if they are breaking up , we use &nbsp; so that the twowors always sticck together.
